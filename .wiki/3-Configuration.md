You can then further change the messages while also using the minecraft color codes. Use & to specify a start of a color code. Do not edit the two values on the bottom of the file or you risk breaking the plugin or resetting all of the data in the file.

**Current supported languages**

| Language | local setting | 
| -------- | -------- |
| English | en_US |
| German | de_DE |

## Leaderboard
**This section is for the leaderboard.yml file**

This config file allows you to change what is displayed on the scoreboard\leaderboard while in the lobby, or in the game. Below are a list of predefined placeholders.


#### LOBBY BOARD PLACEHOLDERS

| Name | Description |

You can use theese placeholders to specify the content of the leaderboards on the side of the screen in both the lobby and while in game. You can also set the speific types of text different place holders will return as well in the config file.


## Items
**This section is for the items.yml file**

If you have pvp enabled, this file will specify what items each player will get. There are two sections for items, one for hiders, and one for seekers. Spectators don't get any items. Below is a table on the parameters, and some examples on some premade items.

| Name | Type | Description |

| name | String | Items name |
| unbreakable | bool | If the item is unbreakable |
| lore | String list | List of lore strings |

**Weapon Example**
```
'1':      
  material: DIAMOND_SWORD
  amount: 1
  enchantments:
    sharpness: 1
  name: 'Seeker Sword'
  unbreakable: true
  lore:
    - 'This is the seeker sword'
```

You can also give potions to your players. Below is a table on what you need, and some examples on how to do it.


| Name | Type | Description |

  material: SPLASH_POTION
  amount: 1
  type: REGEN
```

The next section of the file is effects. These are the effects players on each team will receive after the initial hiding countdown finishes. Again, this section is broken into effects seekers get, and effects hiders get.

You will need to specify the following information:

| Name | Type | Description | 
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| type | [PotionEffectType](https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/org/bukkit/potion/PotionEffectType.html) | The type of potion effect. |
| duration | int | The duration in seconds for the effect to last. Put 1000000 for it to last until the the player switches teams or the game ends |
| amplifier | int | The minecraft effects amplifier. |
| ambient | bool | Makes potion effect produce more, translucent, particles. |
| particles | bool | If the effect should produce particles at all. | 

**Effect Example**
```
'1':
  type: WATER_BREATHING
  duration: 1000000
  amplifier: 1
  ambient: false
  particles: false
```

Finally, the ID's of each of the sections for the effects and items **MUST** be in numerical order. For example, the item marked '1', must then be followed by an item marked '2', otherwise the '2' item will be skipped, along with the rest of the items for that team.
